        <h1>Alignment</h1>
    </div>

        </div>
<div id = "hptext" class="hank-bodytext">
        <h2>What is Alignment?</h2>
        <div class="smallbox">
        <p> Alignments in Dungeons and Dragons essentially describe philosophy and morality. Does your character try to help out a stranger on the street? Does your character hate listening to authority? Alignment helps describe some of those things.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Does it Matter?</h2>
        <div class="smallbox">
        <p>It might not matter at all. It entirely depends on your DM. This might be relevant with some spells or things of the sort (i.e. “Cannot be used by evil aligned characters”). However, it really does entirely depend on what your DM thinks about them. The way they are interpreted also vary between players, but here’s one take on alignments.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Lawful-Chaotic Spectrum</h2>
        <div class="smallbox">
        <p>Lawful people are those who follow the rules. They generally care about societal expectations and boundaries, whether it’s to enforce it or to adhere to them.</p>
        <p>Chaotic people do not necessarily have no dogma. Instead, they follow their own rules and their actions tend to go against the grain. It doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re random or nonsensical people, just independent or alternative.</p>
        <p>Neutral people on this spectrum tend to flux between the two. Maybe they generally follow societal expectations, but then occasionally break the mold.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Good-Evil Spectrum</h2>
        <div class="smallbox">
        <p>Good people are those who care about the general good. They do things to help out their fellow person, and generally try to always do right by people.</p>
        <p>Neutral people on this spectrum tend to care more about a smaller circle. They may not necessarily go out of their way to help someone, but they still care intensely about select friends or family.</p>
        <p>Evil people are those who only care about themselves. They do things that benefit themselves over all else. Everyone in this category is not necessarily like a fairy tale villain, where they try to cause havoc or suffering for sufferings sake. They just prioritize themselves first and foremost, over the general good and over those in their close circle (if they have one).</p>
        </div>

        <h2>So What Are My Options?</h2>
        <div class="smallbox">
        <p><strong>Lawful Good:</strong> Think of your classic protagonist. This person really cares about ideals like justice or friendship, and they want to protect their common man while following the rules. They probably think rules are set to protect us.</p>
        <p><strong>Neutral Good:</strong> This person still is deeply invested in helping others. They may bend some rules sometimes, but generally consider it good to keep to rules.</p>
        <p><strong>Chaotic Good:</strong> This person loves to help out their common man, they just play by their own rules when doing so. They might have an active distruct for the law or might delight in breaking rules.</p>
        <p><strong>Lawful Neutral:</strong> These individuals find dogma and tradition very important. They may hold a steadfast dedication to their family or clan.</p>
        <p><strong>True Neutral:</strong> This would be a person who either has a very nuanced and mixed philosophy, or tries to stay out of the way of moral questions.</p>
        <p><strong>Chaotic Neutral:</strong> These individuals are more fickle. They may choose to help others, but they may not. They value their individual freedom very much.</p>
        <p><strong>Lawful Evil:</strong> This person staunchly believes in the rules and order, and are willing to do what they have to to enforce it. They believe everyone should be doing as they should or even put in their place.</p>
        <p><strong>Neutral Evil:</strong> This person might follow the rules when it serves them, but also may break them as they wish as well. They really just do whatever they can get away with.</p>
        <p><strong>Chaotic Evil:</strong> It’s their way or the highway. They have no regard for other people or the rules.</p>
