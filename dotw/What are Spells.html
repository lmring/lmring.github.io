			<h1>What are Spells</h1>
</div>
			<div class="divider">
				<img src="divider.png"></img>
			</div>

			<div id = "hptext" class="hank-bodytext">
						<h2>What are spells?</h2>
						<div class="smallbox">
						<p> Magic in DND, especially at first level, is not like the video games you’re used to. Spells, except for cantrips, are generally something to be conserved for moments of great need or importance.</p>
						</div>

						<h2>Spellcasting Ability Modifier: A Reminder</h2>
							<div class="smallbox">
								<p>Your spellcasting ability modifier is the modifier for the attribute your class uses to cast spells with. For example, warlocks cast with charisma, so they will add their charisma modifier wherever they are asked to add their spellcasting ability modifier!</p>
							</div>

						<h2>Spell Level: We Went From 0 to 9 Real Fast...</h2>
						<div class="smallbox">
						<h5> Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. These levels represent how powerful the spell is.</h5>
						<p>These levels are different from player levels. A level 9 player typically cannot cast a level 9 spell!
							<br>Cantrips, which we talk more about later, are level 0 spells. To understand more what the levels mean, level 9 spells are the highest level and they are devastating. The most powerful spell in the game is called “Wish”, which can change reality itself. These spells are godly, and typically a character has to be at least 17th level to cast the spell.</p>
						</div>

						<h2>Known and Prepared Spells: Make Your List, Check it Twice</h2>
						<div class="smallbox">
							<p>Some classes have known spells. These spellcasters have a limited list of spells they always have in their mind.</p>
							<p>Other classes have to prepare their spells. They all have a unique system, so consult the book for the specifications. This generally means that before an adventure, they have to go through all of the spells they could know and review the important ones beforehand. Preparing spells can be more work, as you have to read over the spell list and determine which ones you’ll want to take on for the day.</p>
							<p>In all cases, the number of spells they can possess in their mind at any time depends on their level.</p>
						</div>

						<h2>Spell Slots: That's All You've Got</h2>
							<div class="smallbox">
								<p>Spell slots are not the same as spells you know. Spell slots are the number of spells you can cast before you have to recharge them. This entirely depends on level, class, and attributes, so be sure to carefully consult your class’s writeup!</p>
								<p>How do spells recharge?</p>
								<p>This depends on the class, but the majority recover their spells after a long rest. When you’re picking your spells and using them, keep in mind that most spellcasters wake up and only have a certain amount of spells for the day!</p>
								<p>However, warlocks have the express privilege of being able to recharge their spell slots after a short rest. Sorcerers can use their sorcerer points to recover spell slots, alongside other neat things.</p>
						</div>

						<h2>Cantrips: Don't canTRIP on this!</h2>
						<div class="smallbox">
						<p> “Cantrip” is essentially another word for “trick”. These spells can be cast at will without using a spell slot and with no preparation in advance. Because of this, they’re considered level 0. This is how most spellcasters can use magic in their everyday without blowing a precious spell slot.</p>
						</div>

						<h2>Rituals: Save Those Slots!</h2>
						<div class="smallbox">
						<p> Certain spells can be cast as a ritual, which means that they won’t expend a spell slot! It comes with some differences, however.</p>
						<p><strong>Spells cast as a ritual:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Can only be cast by classes that have a feature which lets them do that</li>
								<li>Caster must have the spell prepared or known, unless specified otherwise</li>
								<li>Does not expend a spell slot</li>
								<li>Takes 10 minutes longer to cast than usual, meaning this is usually reserved for outside of battle</li>
							</ul></p>
						</div>

						<h2>How Do I Cast a Spell?</h2>
						<div class="smallbox">
						<p> Short answer? It depends! You'll want to pay attention to the casting time listed, and see if it consumes an action, bonus action, or reaction! Some spells might ask you to roll and add your spellcasting modifier (spellcasting attributes + proficiency bonus) and some might ask for the person receiving the attack to roll to half the damage.</p>
						</div>

						<h2>Range: Free Ranging!</h2>
						<div class="smallbox">
						<p> The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. Look at the description to see what the range is.</p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. </li>
								<li>For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts. Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. </li>
								<li>Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. </li>
								<li>Spells with a range of self can only be used on you.</li>
								<li>Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point at the spell's effect must be you.</li>
							</ul></p>
						</div>

						<h2>Components: Don't Use Me Like This!</h2>
						<div class="smallbox">
						<h5> These are the things you require to cast a spell. They’re represented as V,S, and M!</h5>
						<p><strong>Verbal:</strong>
							Most spells require some kind of mystic words to be chanted, and the spell’s power is fueled by the pitch and resonance of the words. So a character who is gagged, in an area of silence (casted by the spell silence) can’t cast a spell that requires verbal components.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Somatic:</strong>
							Somatic refers to spellcasting gestures. If a spell requires somatic components, then your character must have at least one hand to perform the spell.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Material:</strong>
							Some spells require specific objects, but a character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus in place of components. However, if a cost is indicated, then a character must have that specific component before they can cast the spell.
If the spell states the material component is consumed, then the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.
						</p>
						</div>

						<h2>Duration: Stronger, Better, Faster....Longer</h2>
						<div class="smallbox">
						<h5>This is how long the spell persists. Some spells say that their effects last until the spell is dispelled or destroyed.</h5>
						<p><strong>Instantaneous:</strong>
							This happens right away! Just what it says on the tin.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Concentration:</strong>
							Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep the magic active. If you break the concentration, the spell ends!
							<br>The following things can break concentration:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Casting another spell that requires concentration:</strong> If the new spell doesn’t require concentration, the spell with concentration won’t end! </li>
								<li><strong>Taking damage:</strong> Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, then you have to make a constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If multiple sources are attacking you, you have to make a separate saving throw for each source of damage. </li>
								<li><strong>Being incapacitated or killed:</strong> I mean. You died. You should probably concentrate on that.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						</div>

						<h2>Area of Effect: Spells of Mass Destruction</h2>
							<div class="smallbox">
								<p>Area of Effect spells encompass an area, which allows them to affect multiple creatures at once!<p>
								<p>A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, which may or may not be included in the spell’s effect. See your handbook for specific geometric details, but be aware that your DM may or may not actually care about geometry!</p>
							</div>

						<h2>Saving Throws: Please Roll a 1</h2>
							<div class="smallbox">
								<p>Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.</p>
								<p>The DC (difficulty class) to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.</p>
							</div>

							<h2>Attack Rolls: Please Don’t Roll a 1</h2>
								<div class="smallbox">
									<p>Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>
								</div>
