<h2>What are Skills?</h2>
<div class="smallbox">
Skills represent different aspects of each main attribute. If a character is proficient in a skill, that means they are better at that skill than average. Some of these skills might overlap, so it’s up to your DM to decide what check you need to make!
</div>

<h2>How do Skill Checks Work?</h2>
<div class="smallbox">
When your DM requests that you make a skill check, you will roll a D20 and add the modifier for the attribute that skill belongs to. For example, for an Athletics check, you will add your Strength modifier. If you are proficient in a skill, you will also add your proficiency bonus to the roll result.
</div>

<h2>What skills should I take?</h2>
<div class="smallbox">
We give some recommendations based on general usefulness, but it’s important to keep in mind that it also depends on the style of your Dungeon Master. Every skill is useful at the right moment, so don’t be afraid to take something for the sake of roleplay!

			<h2>Athletics</h2>
					<p>Athletics covers something that takes a significant effort of physical activity. You might make an athletics check to scale a cliff or swim across a river. In times when it’s really needed might to be clear some debris or lift a boulder off of someone. Some DMs might let you make an athletics check in place of an acrobatics check. </p>
					<p>This skill is somewhat important, and there should still generally be someone in the party who is capable of this or acrobatics. This is great for more physical characters who need to achieve something out of combat.</p>

						<p>Sleight of hand refers to physical tricks and theft. You might make a sleight of hand check to perform a card trick, pickpocket someone, or pick a lock.</p>
						<p>This skill is essential for rogues. Do not overlook this skill. If there is not a rogue on the team, it would be very useful to the party if at least one person knows how to pick a lock.</p>

						<p>This skill is one of the most important skills in the game. If you can get your hands on this skill, you really should take it. All classes benefit from knowing how to stealth.</p>

					<p>This skill is a decent one. It’s generally advised that at least one person in the party should have this skill. It can provide more information as the party tries to figure out what is going on in the story or move through a dungeon.</p>

				<h2>History</h2>
						<p>History refers to your knowledge about the history of the world of your campaign. You might make a history check to remember the name of a long-dead king or to recall the outcome of an ancient war.</p>
						<p>This skill is mostly helpful for roleplay. It still might help your character solve mysteries or help them through problems or intrigue. It’s worth looking into if it seems campaign appropriate. However, you could definitely go a long time without having to roll a history check.</p>

						<p>Investigation covers any searching action. You might make an investigation check to look for clues in an old book or to find an escape route from a prison cell.</p>
						<p>This skill is extremely useful. In Dungeons and Dragons, you’ll often find yourself needing to learn more to get out of a sticky situation or find out what to do next! </p>
						<p>The comparative skill is Perception, which could be lightly considered as the wisdom counterpart to this skill. They’re both very useful, but if you have to choose one, perception is better. That being said, if your wisdom sucks, you can just take investigation and maximize on your skills.</p>

						<p>Nature refers to your knowledge about the natural world. You might make a nature check to decide if a plant is edible or to identify a wild animal.</p>
						<p>This skill is not super useful. It really depends on the campaign. If you know you’re going to be doing a lot of nature related things, I would consider it. However, it’s very situational. You will probably be fine letting someone with high wisdom make these checks, you don’t really need the proficiency bonus.</p>

						<p>This skill is mostly just roleplay, but it has its uses. If campaign relevant, it can be really helpful. However, if religion is not very relevant to your story or your DM’s interests, this skill be collecting a lot of dust.</p>

					<p>This skill has its situational uses. Sure it won’t help you punch better, but it’s good for roleplay or getting out of sticky animal related situations. Also, who doesn’t like making a new friend? Who’s a good boy?</p>

						<p>It can be pretty useful seeing through someone’s BS. It’s a solid skill to pick up, and sees its uses. Don’t be afraid to ask to roll an insight check when you want more information!</p>

						<p>This skill is not super useful. The biggest use you will find for it is stabilizing someone so they don’t have to keep rolling their death saving throws. However, you can do the same thing by healing them, even if it’s just one hit point. If your cleric has the spare the dying cantrip, you can just absolutely forget about this skill. </p>

In Dungeons and Dragons, you’ll often find yourself needing to learn more to get out of a sticky situation or find out what to do next! This is also the exact skill that rivals stealth, so you can thwart enemies and prevent yourself from being snuck up on!</p>

						<p>Survival refers to your ability to survive in nature. You might make a survival check to follow animal tracks or to build a shelter for the night.</p>
						<p>This skill is extremely useful, especially if you know you’re going to be travelling a lot in your campaign. You’ll have to find some viable shelter somehow, and this is the skill that makes it happen.</p>

					<p>This skill is nice if you like throwing your weight around. To use this skill, you will have to be cracking some knuckles or making some threats, which could also go badly if your roll goes south. If you’d rather talk your way out of things civilly, take persuasion.</p>
