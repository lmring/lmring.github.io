					<h4>Barbarian:</h4>
					<h4>These folks are some of the toughest in town. They can take blows and give ‘em too! </h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor, Medium armor, Shields</p>
					<p>Weapons: Barbarians are proficient in all weapons.</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d12 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Animal Handling: Nice if you care about roleplaying.</li>
							<li>Athletics: As you are probably one of the strength based units, it might be good to pick this up.</li>
							<li>Intimidation: Nice if you care about roleplaying. However, if your charisma sucks, this isn’t recommended.</li>
							<li>Nature: Not highly recommended. Leave this to your cleric, druid, or ranger.</li>
							<li>Perception: This is one of the most useful skills in the game. Perception checks are extremely important in DND. It helps to know what is going on and hit things before they try to hit you!</li>
							<li>Survival: Great for tracking down enemies, finding a good campsite, and generally a very helpful skill.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Constitution: You will be ideally tanking hits for your party. You’ll need the beef to back it up.</li>
							<li>Strength: Rage is entirely dependent on your strength stat. The entire class is built around this attribute. Also, in order to make the most out of melee weapons, you’ll need to be using strength.</li>
							<li>Dexterity: This is still extremely valuable as you’ll need it to dodge spells and have high initiative. Also, it helps you use ranged weapons should you desire to.</li>
						</ul>
						Note: Wisdom is also recommended. It is generally good to be perceptive but also to resist possession. This will also make more roleplay sense for future Totem Barbarians.
					</p>
					<p>I would like to RAGE!! The barbarian class is entirely dependent on the rage mechanic. Barbarians can go into a rage as a bonus action and receive different benefits, including getting advantage (roll twice and take the higher roll) on Strength checks and saving throws, a bonus to melee weapon attacks, and resistance to different physical damage. As you grow and choose a specialization, your rage will get different benefits and powers.</p>
					<p><h4>Barbarians specialize at level 3. They pick their PRIMAL PATH:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Path of the Ancestral Guardian: You have ancestral spirits that guide and protect you and your friends.</li>
							<li>Path of the Berserker: You’re a classic barbarian. Your rages get more powerful.</li>
							<li>Path of the Storm Herald: You can receive the power of the desert, sea, or tundra. The corresponding effect determines what aura and powers you receive.</li>
							<li>Path of the Totem Warrior: You learn the way of animals, and you gain animalistic powers that increase your battle prowess.</li>
							<li>Path of the Zealot: You become a divine warrior, and divine energy powers your attacks.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container-fluid margot-bodytext class collapse" id="bardFullText">
					<h4>Bard:</h4>
					<h4>Bards are spellcasters who’s spells come from their artistic endeavors. Their songs empower their compatriots, but can also be used to cast some nasty spells! Don’t underestimate these silver tongues!</h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor</p>
					<p>Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, and shortswords.</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d8 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: Three musical instruments of your choice!</p>
					<p><h4>Skills: Any THREE you desire from the whole list! Pick whatever your heart desires, especially things that make sense for the character you’re making. In case you don’t know where to start, here are some nice quality of life recommendations:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Persuasion: Highly recommended. You’ll already have the charisma to back it up. It’s nice being able to get your way just by asking nicely.</li>
							<li>Deception: Same as persuasion, your charisma stat will make this very useful to lie to get what you want. Pretend to be someone else, or lie about what you were doing!</li>
							<li>Perception: This is one of the most useful skills in the game. Perception checks are extremely important in DND. It helps to know what is going on and hit things before they try to hit you!</li>
							<li>Stealth: One of the most useful skills in the game. It’s nice to get where you need to go without provoking any attention from enemies!</li>
							</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Charisma: This is your spellcasting attribute, so consider it the most important one of all. All your spells will benefit from your charisma modifier. Also, it helps to be able to talk your way out of things!</li>
							<li>Dexterity: Many weapons bards can utilize depend on dexterity, whether it’s finesse weapons like rapiers, or any of the ranged weapons at their disposal. </li>
							<li>Constitution: It’s always nice to have health points. Keeps you alive longer! If you prefer your stats informing your roleplay, consider prioritizing Intelligence or Wisdom instead. Those can help you build a personality for your character!</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Bards are one of the most customizable classes. You can take a bard in any direction, whether it be more in a weapons combat direction, or a spellcasting direction.</p>
					<p>What makes bards special is the INSPIRATION mechanic. Bards can inspire others with their music, giving them bonuses to their rolls. This can really make a difference in hard times!</p>
					<p><h4>Bards specialize at level 3. You pick a BARDIC COLLEGE:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>College of Glamour: Your magic becomes powered by the fae and their illusions. You specialize in charms and glamor.</li>
							<li>College of Lore: You study more in what it means to be a spellcaster. You can take spells from other classes, even the most powerful (Wish).</li>
							<li>College of Swords: You become a master of the blade. You can use your magical talents to deal extra damage using a blade. You also gain proficiency in medium armor and scimitars.</li>
							<li>College of Valor: You hone your martial prowess. Opportunities to attack become more plentiful, and you can inspire your allies to become better in battle. You also gain proficiency in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.</li>
							<li>College of Whispers: You lean into the ways of darkness and secrets.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container-fluid margot-bodytext class collapse" id="clericFullText">
					<h4>Cleric:</h4>
					<h4>Clerics are holy people who have devoted themselves to a divine force. Their powers come from one of the many different divine forces across the various pantheons. They are able to use these powers to help their fellows but also to punish their foes.</h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor, medium armor, and shields</p>
					<p>Weapons: Clerics are proficient in all simple weapons.</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d8 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>History: Nice if you like roleplay. This is especially so if you care about details of the story.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to be able to call out someone’s BS.</li>
							<li>Medicine: Not very useful for multiple reasons. You’re the healer, and you can bring someone back from having to do their death saving throws just by healing. Your wisdom modifier can also usually make up for this. Medicine is especially useless if you have the Spare The Dying cantrip, which makes people automatically pass their death saving throws.</li>
							<li>Persuasion: Nice if you like roleplay. However, consider your own charisma stat and if you have more charismatic members of the party like a Paladin or Bard before taking this on.</li>
							<li>Religion: Nice if you like roleplay. You are also a person of faith! Some DMs might also ask for this check frequently if you try to do things related to your deity.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Wisdom: This is your spellcasting attribute, so consider it the most important one of all. All your spells will benefit from your wisdom modifier. Also, it’s nice being able to see things coming!</li>
							<li>Constitution: It’s generally nice if the healer doesn’t die from one kick to the shin.</li>
							<li>Dexterity: This is nice because it helps you use ranged weapons and stay away from the heat of the battle. It can also boost your AC too. It especially helps you survive spell damage that other long range magic users might be throwing your way.</li>
						</ul>
						Note: Strength can be a recommended stat if you are going to build a frontlines cleric. Frontlines clerics are recommended to be something proficient in heavy armor, like Forge, Life, Protection, Tempest, or War clerics.
					</p>
					<p>While clerics can vary based on the domain they choose, they are still spellcasters to the core. Generally, they will want to attack using spells, such as the Sacred Flame cantrip. They usually want to stay to the sidelines, but with the right build focusing on constitution and another physical stat, can be front liners.</p>
					<p><h4>Clerics specialize at level 1. You pick a DOMAIN related to your deity:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Forge Domain: Your deity is one one of the great artisans and crafters. You are imbued with the power of the forge. You gain proficiency with heavy armor.</li>
							<li>Grave Domain: Your deity is one of the watchers over life and death. You respect that all things must come to an end. You are imbued with their powers and can to an extent manipulate the boundary of life and death.<li>
							<li>Knowledge Domain: Your deity is one of the keepers of wisdom and learning. You are able to tap into arcane knowledge like the thoughts of others or visions of the past as you grow more powerful. You also gain proficiency in two more languages, and two of the following skills (Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion).</li>
							<li>Life Domain: Your deity is one who promotes vitality and shows mercy to those sick and wounded. Your healing powers are heightened and even more powerful than your fellow clerics. You also gain proficiency in heavy armor.</li>
							<li>Light Domain: Your deity is one of the light. There are virtues that correspond with light, such as truth, beauty, and renewal. Your radiant powers are heightened, making you especially dangerous to fiends and the undead.</li>
							<li>Nature Domain: Your deity is one of the many forces of nature. While druids worship nature as a whole, you align yourself with a specific deity and their ways. You are able to commune with flora and fauna alike.</li>
							<li>Protection Domain: Your deity calls upon you to protect the weak from the strong. You are given powerful defensive abilities. You also get a proficiency in heavy armor.</li>
							<li>Tempest Domain: Your deity is one of the great and powerful forces who govern over the storm, sea, or sky. You are given powerful storm based combat abilities. You also gain proficiency in martial weapons and heavy armor.</li>
							<li>Trickery Domain: Your deity is one of the great tricksters, whether they be a scoundrel or a thief or a rebel. You are skilled in the ways of stealth and duplicity.</li>
							<li>War Domain: Your deity is one of combat, whether it be a deity of justice or a deity of destruction. You are given martial prowess in battle, and the ability to inspire martial prowess in others as well. You are given proficiency in martial weapons and heavy armor.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="container-fluid margot-bodytext class collapse" id="druidFullText">
					<h4>Druid:</h4>
					<h4>Druids are those who gain their powers from the forces of nature. They have the ability to elemental spells but also to transform into animals.</h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields</p>
					<p>Weapons: Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d8 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: Herbalism Kit</p>
					<p>Note: You are also proficient in the Druidic language. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden languages. People can find the message on a successful DC 15 Perception check, but can’t decipher it without magic.</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Arcana: If you have good intelligence, you can consider this. However, this should really be left up to whoever is the Int person on your team. If you’re a nerd, feel free.</li>
							<li>Animal Handling: Nice if you like roleplay, but can actually be useful to get out of some situations. If there’s any class to be proficient in animal handling, it’s the druid. You also have the Wis to back it up.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to be able to call out people’s BS.</li>
							<li>Medicine: You might want to pick this up if you’re the party’s primary healer. The main use Medicine sees is trying to stabilize bodies so players don’t have to roll death saving throws. If you have a cleric in your party, you really don’t need this because you should have high wis anyways.</li>
							<li>Nature: Nice if you like roleplay and if it’s campaign relevant. If there’s any class to be proficient in nature, it’s the druid. However, your wisdom might be enough to boost you to the point where you don’t really need your proficiency bonus.</li>
							<li>Perception: This is one of the most useful skills in the game. Perception checks are extremely important in DND. It helps to know what is going on and hit things before they try to hit you!</li>
							<li>Religion: Not vital, and you only can pick two from this list. If you want it for roleplaying, maybe consider </li>
							<li>Survival: Great for tracking down enemies, finding a good campsite, and generally a very helpful skill. This will be bolstered by your high Wisdom.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Wisdom: This is your spellcasting attribute, so consider it the most important one of all. All your spells will benefit from your wisdom modifier. Make sure this stat is the highest.</li>
							<li>Dexterity: This is nice because it helps you use ranged weapons and stay away from the heat of the battle. It can also boost your AC too. It especially helps you survive spell damage that other long range magic users might be throwing your way.</li>
							<li>Constitution: Always a nice generic stat to choose, as it gives you more hit points. However, if you care about roleplaying, feel free to focus on any of the other mental attributes.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Druids are fun because there’s a few different ways to go about building your funky nature friend. You can pursue spells, buffs, frontlines, whatever you’d like.</p>
					<p>Druids are notable for their Wild Shape ability. This means they can transform into animals and fight using the animal’s physical stats. They can’t cast spells in this form until much later in the game, but their martial prowess is still not one to be underestimated.</p>
					<p><h4>Druids specialize at level 2. You pick your DRUIDIC CIRCLE:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Circle of Dreams: These druids have an emphasis on healing and mobility, as they get teleportation in later levels.</li>
							<li>Circle of the Land: These druids have an emphasis on spellcasting. If you want to cast spells, this is the class to be.</li>
							<li>Circle of the Moon: These druids have good survivability in exchange for having less boons to their spellcasting.</li>
							<li>Circle of the Shepherd: These druids have summoning capabilities, which allows them to buff their companions and also be in the frontlines.</li>
						</ul>

					<h4>Fighter:</h4>
					<h4>Fighters are exactly what it says on the tin. I mean, everyone else fights too. But they fight MORE.</h4>
					<p>Armor: All armor and shields</p>
					<p>Weapons: Simple weapons and martial weapons</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d10 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Strength, Constitution</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Acrobatics: Being proficient in this or Athletics is a safe bet. You don’t really need both.</li>
							<li>Animal Handling: Nice if you like roleplay. Still, as you’re picking two from this list, you might want to leave it to your druid.</li>
							<li>Athletics: Being proficient in this or Acrobatics is a safe bet. You don’t really need both.</li>
							<li>History: Nice if you like roleplay and have some Int. Makes more sense if you’re a spellcaster fighter, otherwise leave this to your wizard.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to be able to call out other people’s BS.</li>
							<li>Intimidation: Not really a recommended stat unless you have some charisma. Otherwise, leave the talking to the bards and paladins.</li>
							<li>Perception: This is one of the most useful skills in the game. Perception checks are extremely important in DND. It helps to know what is going on and hit things before they try to hit you!</li>
							<li>Survival: Great for tracking down enemies, finding a good campsite, and generally a very helpful skill.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Dexterity: You might wonder why dexterity is at the top of the list, but dexterity is hands down the most important statistic in 5th edition. It helps you go first during combat, dodge attacks, and you can even attack using this for your ranged and finesse weapons. You can’t go wrong with dexterity.</li>
							<li>Strength: Still a very important aspect for fighters. This is less important if you decide to fully build a dexterity based fighter and use finesse weapons and ranged weapons. However, if nobody else in your party emphasizes their strength stat, you should still prioritize this for balance. If you want to be strictly melee, this is also the stat to go for.</li>
							<li>Constitution: You’re a fighter, so you’ll need to be in the frontlines. You’ll need the beef to back it up.</li>
						</ul>
						Note: Wisdom is also recommended. It is generally good to be perceptive but also to resist possession. This will also make more roleplay sense for future Totem Barbarians.
					</p>
					<p>Fighting is what you do. Picking this class means sacrificing some more of the flavor and embracing more of the punch. There are some more flavorful subclasses, but you’re really here because you want to be good at punch.</p>
						<p><h4>Fighters specialize at level 3. You pick a MARTIAL ARCHETYPE. (Note: Feel free to replace “punch” with “stab” or “shoot”):</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Champion: You’re great at punching. Perfect for new players.</li>
							<li>Battle Master: You gain maneuvers that help you in battle. You are still good at punching.</li>
							<li>Eldritch Knight: You get to mix some of that punching with some spells. Your spells primarily focus around defense, whether it be for yourself or others, as you punch real good.</li>
							<li>Arcane Archer: You are so good at shooting arrows. Your arrows can even have special properties or powers, and you can cast some minor spells.</li>
							<li>Cavalier: It’s more than just having a mount. You are also a powerful defender as you punch from atop your horse.</li>
							<li>Samurai: An interesting subclass that adds some more roleplay spice into the class. Also, you are still very, very good at punching.</li>
						</ul>

				<div class="container-fluid margot-bodytext class collapse" id="monkFullText">
					<h4>Monk:</h4>
					<h4>Monks are those who have taken up some kind of discipline or order. They are skilled in martial arts, and these dexterity based fighters are nothing to mess with.</h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor</p>
					<p>Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, and shortswords.</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d8 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: Three musical instruments of your choice!</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Acrobatics: You are a very dexterous person. If you want to get away with some parkour outside of battle, this is a good skill to take.</li>
							<li>Athletics: If you’re going to take this, just take acrobatics.</li>
							<li>History: Nice if you like roleplay.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to see through people’s BS. Also, you should have some hefty wis to boost this.</li>
							<li>Religion: Nice if you like roleplay. Relevance might depend on the campaign you play.</li>
							<li>Stealth: One of the most useful skills in the game. It’s nice to get where you need to go without provoking any attention from enemies! Highly recommend taking this on, as you should have the dexterity to boost it.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Dexterity: This is one of the most important stats in the game, and doubly important for you. Not only does it help you go earlier in battle and dodge magic attacks, but your armor class will be decided by your Dexterity and Wisdom. It will also determine the strength of your attacks, as all monks can use martial arts to attack from dexterity instead of strength.</li>
							<li>Wisdom: This helps determine your armor class, which is very important as you are a front liner. Also, if you cast spells, you’ll be casting from your wisdom.</li>
							<li>Constitution: As a frontliner, this stat is especially important to you. Don’t worry about strength as your dexterity is your strength and eliminates all need for that.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>This class is entirely dex based. Ki points are the most significant part of this class, as they are what allow monks to do some of their more intense abilities. Monks fight in an extremely dextrous way, having the ability to catch projectiles, fall from great distances without being hurt, and run across water.</p>
						<p><h4>Monks specialize at level 3. They pick a MONASTIC TRADITION:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Way of the Open Hand: You are a very talented martial artist. Did you like Ty Lee on Avatar? It’s like that.</li>
							<li>Way of Shadow: Do you want to be a ninja? This is it.</li>
							<li>Way of Four Elements: Pick this if you want to be the avatar. That’s really what this is. You get some elemental spells.</li>
							<li>Way of Drunken Master: Sure do love that… cola. There’s some fun redirection that’s to be expected by the title.</li>
							<li>Way of the Kensei: If you like the idea of armed martial arts, this is the one for you.</li>
							<li>Way of the Sun Soul: You get some cool hadouken abilities! Blast people with the power of sun.</li>
						</ul>

					<h4>Paladin:</h4>
					<h4>Paladins are to clerics as rangers are to druids. These warriors have taken up an oath to serve a deity, and receive impressive divine combat prowess. They also have some powers of healing as well.</h4>

					<p>Weapons: Simple weapons and martial weapons</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d10 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Athletics: As you are probably one of the strength based units, it might be good to pick this up.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to see through people’s BS.</li>
							<li>Intimidation: Nice if you like roleplay. This is especially so if you like throwing your weight around. If you’d rather talk your way out of things civilly, take persuasion.</li>
							<li>Medicine: Really do not recommend this one. You have lay on hands, and can stabilize dying bodies doing their death saving throws by just giving them one hit point. Let your cleric or druid with higher wis take care of this.</li>
							<li>Persuasion: You’ll already have the charisma to back it up. It’s nice being able to get your way just by asking nicely. A little bit better than intimidation because you don’t always have to be mean to get what you want.</li>
							<li>Religion: Nice if you like roleplay. Relevance depends on the campaign.</li>
							</ul>
					</p>

						</ul>
						Note: Wisdom is also recommended. It is generally good to be perceptive but also to resist possession.
					</p>
					<p>Paladins are sort of a mixed bag. They’re primarily melee fighters, and a lot of their skills in this build are designed around that. They have some abilities to heal and buff, but really they’re here to do damage. Keep in mind you are as bulky as you make yourself out to be, whether it be in constitution or in dexterity.</p>
						<p><h4>Paladins specialize at level 3. They pick a SACRED OATH:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Oath of Devotion: This is the most vanilla a paladin will get. If you’re fighting vampires or the undead, this is a great choice.</li>
							<li>Oath of the Ancients: If you want to build a paladin with a naturey twist, this is the class for you!</li>
							<li>Oath of Vengeance: If you want something edgier, you can build a paladin with some darker themes. This paladin is more offensive and good on the hunt.</li>
							<li>Oath of Conquest: This is if you want to be an imperial warrior. Your powers revolve the idea of fear and domination.</li>
							<li>Oath of Redemption: This is a paladin of peace, maybe one who is redeeming themselves for a past crime, or simply someone who wants to see peace for all.</li>
						</ul>

					<h4>Ranger:</h4>
					<h4>Rangers, like druids, are very close to nature. They range from hunters to beastmasters.</h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor, Medium armor, Shields</p>
					<p>Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d10 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Strength, Dexterity</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>THREE skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Animal Handling: Makes a lot of sense for a ranger to be good with animals. It’s a little situationally useful, however, if your character likes animals you should probably take this on.</li>
							<li>Athletics: Shouldn’t be your priority, especially for a ranger. Let someone more strength focused take this one.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to be able to see through people’s BS. You also have some wis to bolster this.</li>
							<li>Investigation: Don’t take this, take perception. Your wis should be far superior to your int.</li>
							<li>Nature: More situationally useful than anything else.</li>
							<li>Perception: This is one of the most useful skills in the game. Perception checks are extremely important in DND. It helps to know what is going on and hit things before they try to hit you!</li>
							<li>Stealth: One of the most useful skills in the game. It’s nice to get where you need to go without provoking any attention from enemies! Highly recommend taking this on, as you should have the dexterity to boost it.</li>
							<li>Survival: If anyone should be good at this, it’s you. Great for tracking down enemies, finding a good campsite, and generally a very helpful skill.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Dexterity: This informs a lot of your abilities as a ranger, whether it’s dealing damage or stealthing ahead so you can scout. Definitely make sure this is your highest stat.</li>
							<li>Wisdom: This also informs a lot of your abilities, such as your survival rolls, your spells and also your perception. Definitely don’t neglect this stat.</li>
							<li>Constitution:  It’d be nice if getting hit once doesn’t kill you. However, you are a long distance fighter, and if you would like to pick up a different mental stat for some roleplay fun, feel free!</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Rangers as to Druids as Paladins are to Clerics. They are similar to Druids and possess the capability to cast spells, however their skillset is invested elsewhere. This class is very powerful at the beginning, but then plateaus at higher levels. If you are invested in the “meta” and want to be the most powerful, ranger is not a recommended class. However, if you enjoy the roleplay and it fits your character, we very much encourage you to take this class on!</p>
						<p><h4>Rangers specialize at level 3. They pick a RANGER ARCHETYPE:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Beast Master: This is for if you want a pet, plain and simple. Your companion is able to fight at your side!</li>
							<li>Gloom Stalker: This class is perfect if your ranger is someone hanging out in the Underdark.</li>
							<li>Horizon Walker: Pick this if you want a ranger with great mobility and, well, range!</li>
							<li>Hunter: This is what it says on the tin. An offensively oriented Ranger that specializes in fighting different kinds of encounters.</li>
							<li>Monster Slayer: Do you like Monster Hunter? This is like Monster Hunter.</li>

				<div class="container-fluid margot-bodytext class collapse" id="rogueFullText">
					<h4>Rogue:</h4>
					<h4>These adventurers are of the more dexterous persuasion. They are fast, deceptive, and cunning. If you don’t like being the stronger and bulkier type, try being the swift! </h4>
					<p>Armor: Light armor</p>
					<p>Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, and shortswords.</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d8 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Dexterity, Intelligence</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: Thieves’ Tools</p>
					<p><h4>FOUR skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Acrobatics: This is a good one to take to help with your rad parkour!</li>
							<li>Athletics: Don’t even bother. If you care, then take acrobatics.</li>
							<li>Deception: A fun one if you’re playing a charismatic rogue or someone who likes to disguise themselves or cheat others.</li>
							<li>Insight: It helps to be able to see through people’s BS. However, you have so many other really great skills to choose from it’s hard to recommend this.</li>
							<li>Intimidation: Nice if you like roleplay. However, for a rogue deception might help more of your abilities.</li>
							<li>Investigation: Makes sense for some of the rogue specializations. If you’re packing more intelligence, this might be a good choice.</li>
							<li>Perception: This is one of the most useful skills in the game. Perception checks are extremely important in DND. It helps to know what is going on and hit things before they try to hit you!</li>
							<li>Performance: Nice if you like roleplay, but it’s hard to recommend when you have so many other great skills to choose from.</li>
							<li>Sleight of Hand: Practically mandatory for a rogue. You need this to pick locks and to steal things. That’s your job.</li>
							<li>Stealth: Practically mandatory for a rogue. It’s worth saying that you have to take this skill.</li>
							</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Dexterity: This informs practically everything you do.</li>
							<li>Constitution: It’d be nice if getting hit once doesn’t kill you. However, you shouldn’t be the one tanking the damage. If you would like to pick a different mental stat for some roleplay fun, feel free!</li>
							<li>Wisdom: As a rogue, you might be scouting ahead. It’s important that you be able to find your way around. However, you can prioritize intelligence or charisma instead for roleplay fun or the reason listed below.</li>
						</ul>
						Note: If you want your rogue to be a spellcaster, then this list is slightly different. If you want to become an Arcane Trickster, Intelligence is one of the most important attributes. If you want to become a swashbuckler, then Charisma is one of your most important attributes.
					</p>
					<p>Rogues are excellent damage dealers. They are not meant to tank, but to find weaknesses and exploit them. You are the swift and the deadly.
						<p><h4>Rogues specialize at level 3. You pick a ROGUISH ARCHETYPE:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Arcane Trickster: You want to cast spells? This is the rogue for you. You get a lot of little tricks to go alongside your thievish abilities.</li>
							<li>Assassin: You are VERY good at murder.</li>
							<li>Inquisitive: You’re like a detective or a private eye… Cool stuff!</li>
							<li>Mastermind: This rogue is more into disguises and manipulation. Comes with good roleplay opportunities.</li>
							<li>Scout: Kind of like a rogue with a pinch of ranger focus for flavor.</li>
							<li>Swashbuckler: This rogue is an impressive duelist!</li>
							<li>Thief: It’s what it says on the tin.</li>

					<h4>Sorcerer:</h4>
					<h4>Sorcerers are mages who have gained their power through some mystical means, whether it be bloodline or supernatural occurrence. These mages are bursting with magical power, and hold within themselves the power to influence the world around them.</h4>

					<p>Weapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows</p>
					<p>Hit Dice: 1d6 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Constitution, Charisma</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Arcana: Worth considering if there’s no other mages or Intelligence oriented people.</li>
							<li>Deception: If you like lying and cheating, this might be fun to take on.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to be able to see through people’s BS. However, you don’t really need this.</li>
							<li>Intimidation: If you like being mean to get what you want, this might be fun to take on.</li>
							<li>Persuasion: More widely applicable than its counterparts of Deception and Intimidation. You are a very charismatic person! Taking this on is a great way of ensuring your talents pay off. Highly recommended.</li>
							<li>Religion: Nice for roleplay, but otherwise you don’t really need this.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Charisma: This is where you’re casting all your spells for. You better be maximizing this stat!</li>

							<li>Constitution: It’d be nice if getting hit once doesn’t kill you, especially with those hit dice. Draconic sorcerers also have the potential to be very bulky. However, if you are a long distance fighter, however, and if you would like to pick up a different mental stat for some roleplay fun, feel free!</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>This spellcaster class is notable because they have more flexibility. You are able to do different things at a moment's notice thanks to your sorcerer points. You can either cast faster, cast more, or any other wacky hijinks. There’s a lot to play with in the sorcerer’s toolkit!</p>
						<p><h4>Sorcerers specialize at level one. You pick a SORCEROUS ORIGIN:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Divine Soul: Need a healer in your party? This origin gives you some nice healing options.</li>
							<li>Draconic Bloodline: If you actually want to be a dragon, don’t just be a dragonborn. You’ll want to pick this origin so you gain the dragon’s toughness and powers. Also, you get dragon wings at some point. Whaat?</li>
							<li>Shadow Magic: Want to be edgy? This sorcerer has some great darkness themed spells.</li>
							<li>Storm Sorcerer: You know Storm from X Men? Yeah, like that.</li>
							<li>Wild Magic: Do you like having fun and ridiculous shenanigans? This class gives you opportunities to retry fails and also just open a box of randomness with every critical hit.</li>

							<li>Nature: Not really necessary, I’d consider it only maybe if your campaign is nature intensive.</li>
							<li>Religion: Nice if you like roleplay.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Three Most Important Stats for this class are:</h4>
						<ul>

							<li>Dexterity: Having a higher dexterity is nice because you’ll be higher in the initiative order, and you can dodge some of the spells that people are trying to throw at you. This will also help a frontlines warlock as well!</li>
							<li>Constitution: It’d be nice if getting hit once doesn’t kill you, especially with those hit dice. This is especially important if you’re a hexblade. However, if you are a long distance fighter, however, and if you would like to pick up a different mental stat for some roleplay fun, feel free!</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>This class is for people who enjoy consistency or like different perks that can be offered. There are a lot of ways to build a warlock, whether in the frontlines or doing devastating damage from the back. You get some great perks like being able to recover spells after a short rest, and powering up your cantrips. You’ll often have some spells at your disposal.</p>
						<p><h4>Warlocks specialize at level one. You pick your OTHERWORLDLY PATRON:</h4>

					<h4>Wizard:</h4>
					<h4>These spellcasters are those who have earned their magical abilities through hard work. They have studied tirelessly and been rewarded for their efforts with arcane knowledge and abilities. They can grow in their power to be some of the most powerful adventurers in the game.</h4>

					<p>Hit Dice: 1d6 </p>
					<p>Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom</p>
					<p>Tools Proficiencies: None</p>
					<p><h4>TWO skills from:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Arcana: A high recommendation, as if any class should know about arcana, it’s the wizard.</li>
							<li>History: Nice if you like roleplay. This is also especially boosted by your intelligence.</li>
							<li>Insight: It’s nice to see through other people’s BS. However, the other options go better with your build.</li>
							<li>Investigation: A great alternative to perception, or supplement to it as well. You also have the intelligence to really boost this and help you out.</li>
							<li>Medicine: You would be using this only to stabilize a body so they don’t have to roll death saving throws. Not particularly useful, especially if you have an actual healer on the team.</li>
							<li>Religion: Nice if you like roleplay. Your intelligence also bolsters this.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><h4>Wizards specialize at 2nd level. You pick an ARCANE TRADITION:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Intelligence: Intelligence was built for wizards. All of your spells and power come from this stat, so make sure that it’s as high as can be.</li>
							<li>Dexterity: Having a higher dexterity is nice because you’ll be higher in the initiative order, and you can dodge some of the spells that people are trying to throw at you. Having a higher dexterity will also help with your Mage Armor.</li>

					</p>
					<p>Being a wizard, it takes some time for your power to grow. Wizards are especially fun because they learn more spells than any other class. You know more than other spellcasters, but don’t have as many spell slots.</p>
						<p><h4>Barbarians specialize at level 3. They pick their PRIMAL PATH:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>School of Abjuration: This is the defensive school of magic. You’re good at protecting your friends!</li>
							<li>School of Conjuration: This school of magic will conjure things out of thin air! You can create things and also teleport.</li>
							<li>School of Divination: Your magic is oriented around being able to see something coming before it happens. You’re also just good at seeing things! In the dark, invisible creatures, other planes of existence, you name it!</li>
							<li>School of Enchantment: This school of magic specializes in beguiling and entrancing other creatures. Lots of charm spells here!</li>
							<li>School of Evocation: This is what we picture when we say wizard. Blow things up, throw some lightning at someone, freeze something, all of those really dynamic things and more are at your disposal!</li>
							<li>School of Illusion: It’s what it says on the tin.</li>
